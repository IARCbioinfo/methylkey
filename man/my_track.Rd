\title{Create a genome track plot with CpG, DMRs, and probe annotations}
\usage{
my_track(
  dt,
  betas,
  genome = "hg19",
  chromosome = "Chr1",
  start = 0,
  end = 5000
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dt}{A data frame containing the probe information.}

\item{betas}{A matrix containing beta values.}

\item{genome}{The genome assembly version (e.g., "hg19").}

\item{chromosome}{The chromosome to display (e.g., "Chr1").}

\item{start}{The start position of the genome region to display.}

\item{end}{The end position of the genome region to display.}
}
\value{
A genome track plot displaying CpG islands, DMRs, and probe annotations.
}
\description{
This function generates a genome track plot that includes various annotations, such as CpG islands, DMRs (Differentially Methylated Regions), and probe annotations. It takes a data frame 'dt' containing the probe information, a matrix 'betas' containing beta values, and additional parameters for specifying the genome region to display.
